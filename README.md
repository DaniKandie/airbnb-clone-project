### Why User-Friendly Design Matters

A good booking experience helps users complete tasks without confusion or frustration.  
It improves customer trust, increases conversion rates, and reduces drop-offs.  
By keeping the design simple, responsive, and clear, users are more likely to complete their bookings and return in the future.
